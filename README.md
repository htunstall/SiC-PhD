# Silicon Carbide PhD (SiC-PhD)

This repository contains all of the scripting and input/output files (excluding trajectories) for my PhD project titled: *A Machine Learned Potential for Silicon Carbide*.

It is currently in the process of getting updated to place the files and scripts in meaningful locations.
